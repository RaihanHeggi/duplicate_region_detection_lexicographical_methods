1. Duplication detection algorithm, taken from Exposing Digital Forgeries by Detecting Duplicated Image Region; Fast and smooth attack detection algorithm on digital image using principal component analysis, but sensitive to noise and post region duplication process

2. Robust detection algorithm, taken from Robust Detection of Region-Duplication Forgery in Digital Image; Slower and having rough result attack detection algorithm but are considered robust towards noise and post region duplication process
